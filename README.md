# The Pat Pat Bot ❤️
A bot that replies to the tweets it is mentioned in with a GIF file made using Python-3 (Tweepy) and [Twitter APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/). This is a quick mini-project I made in an hour to learn Twitter API and have some fun exploring the Twitter tools.

To get a response, just tweet ```@patPatBot_ #pat``` and wait!

### How Do I Run It?
- Make sure you have Python v3+ installed
- Install tweepy using ```pip3 install --user tweepy```
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to ```bot/bot.py``` and change the following with your credentials:
```
consumer_key = '<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OWN>'
consumer_secret = '<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OWN>'
access_token = '<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OWN>'
access_token_secret = '<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-OWN>'
```
- Navigate to the project directory and execute using ```python3 bot.py```

### Can I Contribute Changes?
Ofcourse you can contribute! As the bot is fully open source, you can always open a pull request with your desired changes and I can take a look to verify and merge it.
